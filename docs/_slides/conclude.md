## Sharing the Model

To send this model to someone, you need to send the Netlogo model, plus the data folder full of data. Itâ€™s
best to zip the model and data folder together at the same time.

## A Few Parting Tips ...

Things to consider when thinking about using GIS data in a Model ...

Tip 1: Models can be effective and efficient without incorporating GIS

Tip 2: If you use GIS data, you raise the expectation that your model represents realistic behavior. This means your audience may have less tolerance for inconsistencies with a GIS based model than if they were viewing an abstract model.

Tip 3: If you use GIS data, try to also visually represent the layers in a meaningful and visually appealing way.

Tip 4: If you create a model with GIS data, you have to send the model and the folder of GIS data to the end user as a zip package. Or you can export Netlogo world and send this as the base data to import into the model.
